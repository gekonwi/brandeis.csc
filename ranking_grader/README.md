ranking_grader
=============

The initial application of this algorithm was targeted at Brandeis University in Fall 2014. In the class CS118a Computer Supported Collaboration, taught by Prof. Richard Alterman, the students were asked to rank each others solutions anonymously within a special group setup and multiple rankings for each solution. In parallel the TAs were grading each solution.

I proposed this algorithm for grading the students' abilities to rank their peers' solutions as close as possible to the TAs' gradings of these solutions. Therefore, of course, the students cannot know the TAs' gradings before the students define their rankings.
